## Introduction

**CZAN** is a design system, named in honor of [Paul Cezanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne), a renowned painter from Aix-en-Provence, France, the developer's hometown.

---

This framework is specifically adapted for apps running on [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) and will apply a specific look & feel for the targeted platforms:

- ü§ñ Android: [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google's open-source design system
- üçé iOS: Cupertino, Apple's design system

---

**CZAN** is following the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology, where atoms, molecules and organisms are the different levels of design you can
use to build your app.
